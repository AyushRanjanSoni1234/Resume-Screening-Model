# Resume-Screening-Model
The project can screen resumes within a specific professional domain, effectively evaluating candidates' qualifications. This feature defines the core functionality of the project. 
To develop the model, this project encompasses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning concepts. Additionally, it employs the pickle library to serialize and deserialize the Python object structure, enhancing the model's persistence and reusability. These practices are integral to the data science methodology applied in this project.
